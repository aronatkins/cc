    <h1>Coding Club Resources</h1>
    <p>
      These are some resources to get you started if you are thinking about
      exposing your child to programming. We have found them helpful (and will
      likely be seen in the Stratton Coding Club).

      <dd>
        Code.org is a site that helps expose children to the fundamental
        concepts used while programming. Many of the exercises are
        puzzle-based, but there are also more open-ended environments to
        explore.

      <dt><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Scratch is a project of the MIT Media Lab that helps young people
        learn to code. Best suited for slightly older students, Scratch offers
        a very similar program-building environment to Code.org and should be
        a good next-step.

      <dt><a href="http://www.scratchjr.org">Scratch Jr</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Scratch Jr is a version of Scratch tailored for younger children
        (5-7). Available as an app for iOS and Android tablets.

      <dd>
        The Code.org folks have compiled a number of other learning resources
        for students interested in programming, both as part of
        the <a href="https://code.org/learn">"Hour of Code"</a> and then as
        opportunities in <a href="https://code.org/learn/beyond">further
          exploration</a>.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        Skills like problem solving, logical reasoning, and debugging are not
        exclusive to computers! Puzzle games like the ones
        from <a href="http://www.smartgamesusa.com">SmartGames</a> are
        sometimes a softer introduction to the same concepts. They're great
        when you're trying to limit screen time!
